# odin-recipes

This project aims to demonstrate the HTML knowledge I have acquired at this point, including how to set up a basic boilerplate HTML document with elements such as headings, images and links. The website itself will be about recipes, with links to different recipes on it. It will be a fun project to demonstrate what I have learned.
